I'm a perpetually curious, knowledge hoarding (my wife would say book hoarding), software engineer. I do a lot of different things in my free time. In the last couple months the main projects have been in electronics, woodworking, art and DIY around the house. 

My goal is to introduce a scientific foundation into my life. I'll be doing this by taking an engineering approach in the projects I'll develop in the coming years. But not only in projects but in the ideas that I hold. I want to move away from making assumptions, and going on gut feelings, to using data to make decisions and understand the world around me.
