I'm a perpetually curious, knowledge hoarding software engineer. My wife would say I am a book hoarder, but I disagree, books are an extension of my brain.

I do a lot of different things in my free time. In the last couple of months, the leading projects have been in electronics, woodworking, art, and home upgrades.

My goal is to introduce a scientific foundation in my life. I'll be doing this by taking an engineering approach in the projects I develop in the coming years. But this will not only be in projects but in the ideas that I hold. I want to move away from making assumptions, and going on gut feelings, to using data to make decisions and understand the world around me.elings, to using data to make decisions and understand the world around me.
