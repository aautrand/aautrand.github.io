# I'm Starting a SaaS Business

Ok, I may have slightly misled you there. I'm actually working on learning how to architect a company. The goal isn't to make money, I want to go through the motions of building everything around a "unicorn product". I don't have such product, what I have instead is a website that serves an api that return "Hi". For now at least.  

In the back of my mind I have thoughts of eventually flipping things on their heads, instead of finding solutions to problems, taking solutions and finding problems that require their implementation.

But that is for later. Right now I'll focus on the absolute basics and deliver a performant, reliable product that return the word "Hi" to the hundreds of thousands of fake requests I generate.

This is my current plan:

First, is to make a proof of concept. That is already done. I have a python application that returns "Hi" when you go to the home page. To run it you need to use "python app.py" and if you close the terminal, the app stops running.

Second, I need to do the system design. According to the market research I just made up in my head, there's going to be high demand for my application in Europe, the Pacific and the Americas. The highest demand will be in North America. 

Since this product will clearly be considered critical infrastructure, I'll need high availability and reliability, and it needs to scale because any minute now the East Coast will realize how much they'll need my API. Customers will need a way to process payments and cancel. Since this a one man show and I wont have the bandwidth to handle customer service, I'll have to delegate that to an AI most likely.

I also expect to have 100's of developers after my first sale, so I'll need to have the development infrastructure ready for that.

It will also be self service, so there needs to be a frontend to process payments. I'm a millenial and I appreciate the minimalist philosophy so there wont be any fancy ui. Just plain old html.

Because this is a business, I need to know how much it's going to cost to run. So I'll have to research which company.
