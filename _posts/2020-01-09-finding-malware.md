How do you purposely find malware?

I mean, I know I’ve gotten viruses before from sites that I didn’t were previously hacked. But in these cases I stumbled upon em on accident. My question is, how do you go on about doing this on purpose? How do you go from not having anything to identifying that a piece of malware on a website and figuring out what it’s actually doing.


In this first attempt I'll be trying to find malware where someone has hijacked an existing website and inserted into the scripts ome kind of code to extract user's information.

In general, we'll want to follow these steps:

    1. get a list of commonly used websites
    2. build a crawler
    3. parse each script file for references to URI’s.


# How do we do this?

For this project I'll be using python.

I'll need requests and BeautifulSoup4. Requests will be used for downloading the website's content and beautifulsoup for parsing the content.

The first step will be to have a list of sites I'll want to check. In the final version I'll want a really big list of sites to increase the odds of finding something good. But for now I'll only be using a small hand written list. 

In this first iteration I'll focus on: From a list of websites, go to each one and get all js files and their contents.

# Future Suggestions

One thing I think could help detect any shennanigans would be to locally save the scripts and run a hash comparison on a daily basis.
