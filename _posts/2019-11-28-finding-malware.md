title: "Finding Malware"

*Draft*

How do you find malware? How do you purposely find malware?

I mean, I know I’ve gotten some before from sites that I didn’t know had been previously hacked. But I stumbled upon it on accident. But how do you go on about doing this on purpose? How do you go from not having anything to identifying that a piece of malware on a website and figuring out what it’s actually doing.


That’ll be the goal for this post.

    1. get a list of commonly used websites
    2. build a crawler
    3. save the js from each.
    4.parse the code to find references to URI’s.


I think this should get us at least one thing. Even if it’s by script kiddies.
